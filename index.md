## Hi there!
I am a first-year PhD student in Natural Language Processing at ETH ZÃ¼rich, working at [rycolab](https://rycolab.io/) with [Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/authors/ryan/). Before, I did my undergraduate in Computer Science at Cambridge followed by two years working in the software industry, before returing to ETH for a masters degree.

Interests:
* Formal languages and [parsing](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-short.6/) 
* Theoretical [capabilities of language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12942) 
* Biologically inspired ML like [predictive coding](/assets/documents/Predictive_Coding.pdf)


## Other activities

Outside of CS, I like to play [Jazz piano](https://www.instagram.com/franznowakjazz). I also enjoy chess and free diving.
