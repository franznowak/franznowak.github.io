## About me
I am a second year MSc student at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/), majoring in Machine Intelligence and focusing on Natural Language Processing. Before that, I completed my undergraduate in Computer Science at [Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) where I did my final project on machine learning applied to database indexing, followed by two years working in the software industry.

My main focus currently lies in formal languages such as [context-free grammars](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-short.6/) and in the investigation of the [theoretical capabilities of neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12942). Aside from that I am also interested in machine translation, natural language generation, and biologically inspired machine learning (such as [predictive coding](/assets/documents/Predictive_Coding.pdf)).


## Other activities

Outside of CS, I like to play [Jazz piano](https://www.instagram.com/franznowakjazz). I also enjoy chess and free diving.
