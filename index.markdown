## About me
I am a second year MSc student at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/), majoring in Machine Intelligence and focusing on Natural Language Processing. Before that, I completed my undergraduate in Computer Science at [Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) where I did my final project on machine learning applied to database indexing, followed by two years working in the software industry.

My main interests include Linguistics, Natural Language Generation, Machine Translation, and AI Safety.

You can find my current CV [here](assets/documents/CV_2022.pdf).


## Recent projects

**Overcoming Theoretical Limitations of Soft Attention** [[github](https://github.com/giacomocamposampiero/palindrome-transformer)][[pdf](assets/documents/AFLT_Project_Report.pdf)]

**Creating a dataset for Logical Fallacy Detection** [[github](https://github.com/franznowak/kialoparser)][[pdf](assets/documents/CSNLP_Project_Report.pdf)][[poster](assets/documents/CSNLP_Poster.pdf)]
* Created a dataset and trained a transformer to classify statements as logically valid or fallacious with an accuracy of 89% on the test set. ([CSNLP](http://www.mrinmaya.io/teaching_csnlp22) course project, Jul 2022)

**A Comparison of Techniques for Sentiment Classification** [[github](https://github.com/franznowak/twitter-sentiment-classification)][[pdf](assets/documents/CIL_Report.pdf)]
* Evaluated a range of models for sentiment classification, showing that transformer-based architectures (BERT) outperform standard classification algorithms. ([CIL](http://da.inf.ethz.ch/teaching/2022/CIL/) course project, Jul 2022)

## Other activities

Outside of CS, I also play [Jazz piano](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWHp49BRdifkD31RERdBD_A). I also enjoy chess and free diving.
