## About me
I am a second year MSc student at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/), majoring in Machine Intelligence and focusing on Natural Language Processing. Before that, I completed my undergraduate in Computer Science at [Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) where I did my final project on machine learning applied to database indexing, followed by two years working in the software industry.

My main interests include Linguistics, Natural Language Generation, Machine Translation, and AI Safety.

You can find my current CV [here](assets/documents/CV_2022.pdf).


## Publications

### [A Fast Algorithm for Computing Prefix Probabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02303)

To be published in the Proceedings of ACL 2023

This paper proposes a new fast algorithm for computing prefix probabilities under a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG).

Recommended citation: Franz Nowak and Ryan Cotterell. 2023. A Fast Algorithm for Computing Prefix Probabilities. In Proceedings of the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), Toronto, Canada.

## Recent projects

### Regularization for Predictive Coding Networks [[github](https://github.com/andreakiro/regularization-pc)][[pdf](assets/documents/Predictive_Coding.pdf)]

Investigating novel regularization techniques for neural networks using predictive coding instead of backpropagation for learning. ([Deep Learning](http://da.inf.ethz.ch/teaching/2022/DeepLearning/) course project, Jan 2023)

### Overcoming Theoretical Limitations of Soft Attention [[github](https://github.com/giacomocamposampiero/palindrome-transformer)][[pdf](assets/documents/Palindrome_Transformer.pdf)]

Found explicit encoding of a regular language and a context free, non-regular language using Transformer soft attention. ([Advanced Formal Language Theory](https://rycolab.io/classes/aflt-s22/) course project, Aug 2022)

### Distinguishing Logical Fallacies from Valid Arguments [[github](https://github.com/franznowak/kialoparser)][[pdf](assets/documents/Fallacy_Detection.pdf)][[poster](assets/documents/CSNLP_Poster.pdf)]

Created a dataset and trained a transformer to classify statements as logically valid or fallacious with an accuracy of 89% on the test set. ([Computational Semantics for NLP](http://www.mrinmaya.io/teaching_csnlp22) course project, Jul 2022)
