## About me
I am a second year MSc student at [<ins>ETH Zürich</ins>](https://ethz.ch/), majoring in Machine Intelligence and focusing on Natural Language Processing. Before that, I completed my undergraduate in Computer Science at [<ins>Cambridge</ins>](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) where I did my final project on machine learning applied to database indexing, followed by two years working in the software industry.

My main focus currently lies in formal languages and in investigation the theoretical capabilities of neural networks. Aside from that I am also interested in machine translation, natural language generation, and biologically inspired machine learning (such as [predictive coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09467)).


## Publications

### [<ins>A Fast Algorithm for Computing Prefix Probabilities</ins>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02303)

To be published in the Proceedings of ACL 2023.

This paper proposes a new fast algorithm for computing prefix probabilities under a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG).

### [<ins> Electron Holographic Measurement of the Three-Dimensional Electrostatic Potential Distribution of a Flat Capacitor </ins>](assets/documents/abstract_3d_capacitor.pdf)

I developed a software tool in Java for simulating 3-D electron holography experiments, saving many hours usually spent calibrating the experiments on expensive machines.
